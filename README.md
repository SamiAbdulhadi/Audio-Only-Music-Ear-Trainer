# Audio-Only-Music-Ear-Trainer

This hands-free application for music ear training does not require any answer selection which I have found lacking from other ear training applications that require your sight for selecting an answer to an aural prompt. Since this skill only minimally requires an open ear, there are many hours in the day that could be utilized for practice while you leave your eyes and hands free (driving, working, cleaning, etc).
